<h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
<p className="updated">Last updated: 27 May 2025</p>

<p>Thank you for choosing Remodelix AI ("App"). These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") form a legally
    binding agreement between you ("User" or "you") and CraftersLabs OU., a company registered in
    Estonia, with its principal place of business at Harju maakond, Tallinn, Kesklinna linnaosa, Kaupmehe tn 7-120, 10114
    ("Company," "we," "our," or "us"). By downloading, installing, accessing, or using the App—or any
    services, content, or features offered through the App (collectively, "Services")—you acknowledge that
    you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and by our Privacy Policy, incorporated
    by reference.</p>

<p>If you do not agree to these Terms, do not download, install, or use the App.</p>

</ul>

<h2>2. Account Registration & Security</h2>
<p>To access certain features, you must create an account using Apple Sign‑In, email/password, or other
    supported credentials. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login information
    and for all activities that occur under your account. Notify us immediately of any unauthorized use.</p>

<h2>3. License Grant</h2>
<p>Subject to your continuous compliance with these Terms, we grant you a limited, non‑exclusive,
    non‑transferable, revocable license to download and use one copy of the App on any Apple‑branded device
    that you own or control for your personal, non‑commercial purposes (unless you purchase a commercial‑use
    subscription as described in § 7).</p>

<p>The App uses generative artificial‑intelligence models to create interior‑design images, 3‑D renders,
    color palettes, and associated metadata ("AI Content") based on User inputs.</p>

<p><strong>Ownership.</strong> As between you and us, all AI Content is owned by us. When you generate AI
    Content through the App while on an active paid plan, we grant you a worldwide, royalty‑free, perpetual
    license to use, reproduce, and display that AI Content for lawful purposes, subject to restrictions in §
    9 (Prohibited Uses). Free‑tier users receive a personal, non‑commercial license only.</p>

<p><strong>No Warranties.</strong> AI Content may contain inaccuracies or infringe third‑party
    intellectual‑property rights. You are solely responsible for verifying AI Content before relying on or
    publishing it.</p>

<p><strong>Right to Remove.</strong> We reserve the right (but have no obligation) to review and delete AI
    Content that we, in our sole discretion, deem harmful, infringing, or otherwise objectionable.</p>

<h2>5. Augmented‑Reality Safety Notice</h2>
<p>Our AR feature overlays virtual objects onto your physical environment. Always remain aware of
    real‑world surroundings, ensure adequate lighting, and use caution when interacting with AR scenes. Do
    not operate a vehicle or machinery while using the AR feature. You assume all risks arising from AR
    use.</p>
